# About

This project was generated by the restapi tool. Its main purpose is to create and run tests against your RESTful API using a declarative descriptor as input.
The service descriptors are yaml files under the `services folder`.
YAML is a user friendly, easily writable format.
The descriptor is both a documentation of your RESTful API and the input for the test generator.

# Project Layout

test
: The generated test cases are put here
: You better create new templates and not modify the generated files
: However you might choose to apply special, tweeks to a particular case, what you do not want to be overwritten by the generator
: For this reason the generator skipps already existing files

config.yml
: This is the configuration of the application
: The `baseUrl` is mandatory
: The `loginCredentials` is optional, if given the generated test cases should make use of this data
: You may extend it as needed, if so, make sure tho modify the application to use them

Makefile
: Used for running the tests

# Using

First run:

	$ npm install

This will install the dependencies.

Second. Populate the `templates`, `bodies`, `schemas` to cover your needs. Also fill in the descriptors.

Third. Generate the test cases, by running:

	$ restapi test --update

Fourth. You migh need to fine-tune a test case after generation.

Fifth. You run the tests.

	$ make test

*Note* you might want to use the test command from a CI server for regression testing.
